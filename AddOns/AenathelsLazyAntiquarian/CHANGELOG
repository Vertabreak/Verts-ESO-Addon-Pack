Updated for Blackwood.

[B]1.1.0[/B] - 2021-05-29
Renamed Auto-scry to Smart Scry to avoid giving the impression that this addon automates the scrying process.

Fixed antiquities filter so wrong antiquities are not used in Smart Scrying.

Don't announce scrying of an antiquity if it cannot be scried because of being in combat etc.

Remove startup message and LibChatMessage dependency.

Add German localization provided by Baertram.

[B]1.0.0[/B] - 2021-05-24
